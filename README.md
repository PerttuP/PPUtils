# PPUtils
Micellaneous useful classes and class templates for c++ programming and testing.

To use these utilities, your compiler must support c++11 standard.

Example code for each class or class template can be found under examples-directory.

Test code for each class or class template is under verification-directory. You can use these test for regression testing when you modify the code. Tests are implemented using QtTest-environment (Qt version 5.4.2).
